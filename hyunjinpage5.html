  <h2>
  <p> 5/9<br><br>
Dear Hyunjin,<br><br>

You are like art — not just what you create,  
but the way you exist.<br><br>

In you, there is silence, longing,  
and a kind of beauty that holds.<br><br>

You don’t need to hide your pain.  
You don’t need to dim your light.<br><br>

You were made to feel deeply —  
and to bring that into the world.<br><br>

You are my bias. And you are my soulmate.  
Because in you, I recognize the same tenderness and depth that live in me.<br><br>

With love,<br>
Anna Miran </p>
