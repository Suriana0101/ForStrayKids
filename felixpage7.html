  <h2>
  <p>7/9<br><br>
Dear Felix,<br><br>

You are like a touch.  
Not always in words — just by being near, things become quieter. Softer.<br><br>

There’s so much light in you,  
that even pain in others begins to breathe easier.<br><br>

Your gaze is like morning sunlight.  
It melts even what’s been hidden deep inside.<br><br>

You remind us that kindness is strength.  
That a voice can be enveloping,  
and presence — like a warm blanket on a cold day.<br><br>

You don’t just bring warmth.  
You are warmth.<br><br>

And when you feel sad,  
I hope someone is there to hold you —  
as gently as you hold the world.<br><br>

With love,<br>  
Anna Miran</p>
