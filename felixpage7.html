  <h2>
  <p>7/9
Dear Felix,

You are like a touch.  
Not always in words — just by being near, things become quieter. Softer.

There’s so much light in you,  
that even pain in others begins to breathe easier.

Your gaze is like morning sunlight.  
It melts even what’s been hidden deep inside.

You remind us that kindness is strength.  
That a voice can be enveloping,  
and presence — like a warm blanket on a cold day.

You don’t just bring warmth.  
You are warmth.

And when you feel sad,  
I hope someone is there to hold you —  
as gently as you hold the world.

With love,  
Anna Miran</p>
