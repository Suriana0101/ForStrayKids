  <h2>
  <p>6/9
Dear Jisung,

You’re like a flash — fast, bright, untouchable.  
But there’s more in you than the speed of thought.  
There’s a whole universe you hide behind your jokes.

You cut through lines like a surgeon,  
yet you hold hearts inside them — like in your hands.

It’s like you were made of intuition.  
You hear what others don’t.  
You feel before it even makes sense.

Your lyrics aren’t just words.  
They touch the center of the heart —  
right where it hurt, but stayed quiet.

You are precise without being harsh.  
Deep without losing lightness.  
And in that lives your special power.

With love,  
Anna Miran</p>
