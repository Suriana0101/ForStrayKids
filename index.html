  <p>
    This is a special letter written with love for all 8 of you — Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin, and I.N.
  </p>
   <p>1/9<br><br>
Dear children,<br><br>

Sometimes “goodbye” sounds louder than “stay.”  
Sometimes love means not holding on, but staying close — in silence.<br><br>

You make millions of STAY happier by giving up your childhood, your wishes, reshaping yourselves.  
But know this — a mother’s heart will always be a place where you are loved, understood, and accepted just as you are.<br><br>

Stray kids are always awaited at home.<br><br>

With love, from a mother’s heart,  <br>
Anna Miran </p>
