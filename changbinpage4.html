  <h2>
  <p> 4/9<br> 
  Dear Changbin,<br>

  You don’t need to be louder to be heard.  
  You already speak — in every verse, every word, every beat.<br>

  Your strength is in precision and speed.  
  You’re not just talented — you’re real.  
  And that’s felt deeper than you may ever know.<br>

  You are a pillar. You are a foundation.  
  Not only for your members —  
  but for millions of STAY.<br>

  Your heart speaks through music.  
  And everyone who listens feels a little closer to themselves.<br>

  With love,<br>  
  Anna Miran </p>
