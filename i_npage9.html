  <h2>
  <p>9/9
Dear Jeongin,

You once wanted to become a priest.  
And now you’re an idol.  
But your path remains the same:  
to serve people, to heal hearts, to carry light.

You know how to be strong and gentle.  
Open, but never exposed.  
You don’t ask for attention, yet it naturally comes to you.

There’s a quiet magnetism in you,  
one that needs no performance.  
A kind of inner sensuality —  
rooted in maturity, confidence, and grace.

And that smile of yours…  
It’s like the moment when all tension melts away.  
And you simply exist.

Thank you for walking your path,  
for preserving that rare honesty  
that makes the world feel just a bit warmer.

With love,  
Anna Miran</p>
