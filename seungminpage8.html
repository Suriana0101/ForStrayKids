  <h2>
  <p>8/9<br>
Dear Seungmin,<br>

You are like the line between light and shadow.  
You know exactly where your boundary is,  
and you never lose yourself, even in the world’s noise.<br>

There’s quiet strength in you.  
No extra words. No drama.  
Just a pure presence.<br>

You are precise without being cold.  
Graceful without being showy.  
Kind — and sometimes even a little naive.<br>

Your loyalty to yourself is a pillar  
not only for you, but for those around you.<br>

Thank you for your clarity,  
for a voice that reaches through time and distance,  
and for the kind of beauty that doesn’t seek attention  
but stays in the memory.<br>

With love,<br>  
Anna Miran</p>
