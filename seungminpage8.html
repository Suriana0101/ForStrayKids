  <h2>
  <p>8/9
Dear Seungmin,

You are like the line between light and shadow.  
You know exactly where your boundary is,  
and you never lose yourself, even in the world’s noise.

There’s quiet strength in you.  
No extra words. No drama.  
Just a pure presence.

You are precise without being cold.  
Graceful without being showy.  
Kind — and sometimes even a little naive.

Your loyalty to yourself is a pillar  
not only for you, but for those around you.

Thank you for your clarity,  
for a voice that reaches through time and distance,  
and for the kind of beauty that doesn’t seek attention  
but stays in the memory.

With love,  
Anna Miran</p>
