  <h2>
  <p>2/9

     Dear Chan,

     You were the first to carry it all —  
     the weight, the choices, the silence after everyone leaves the room.

     You know how to be the light, even when you're standing in the dark.  
     And your smile… it’s both a blade and a balm — healing hearts, and cutting through them too.

     With love,  
     Anna Miran  </p>
